# Multi-Business Dashboard Implementation

## Overview
Implemented a business selector in the dashboard that allows owners with multiple businesses to switch between them and view business-specific data.

## Changes Made

### 1. API Endpoint - `/api/me/businesses`
**File**: `app/api/me/businesses/route.ts` (NEW)

- Created a new API endpoint to fetch all businesses owned by the authenticated user
- Uses the `get_user_businesses()` database function from migration 013
- Returns business ID, name, subdomain, primary flag, and join date
- Protected with `withAuth` middleware

### 2. Business Context
**File**: `src/contexts/BusinessContext.tsx` (NEW)

- Created a React Context to manage business state across the dashboard
- Fetches user's businesses on mount
- Auto-selects primary business or first available business
- Persists selected business in localStorage
- Provides:
  - `businesses`: Array of all user's businesses
  - `selectedBusiness`: Currently selected business object
  - `selectedBusinessId`: ID of selected business
  - `selectBusiness()`: Function to change selected business
  - `refreshBusinesses()`: Function to reload businesses
  - Loading and error states

### 3. Business Selector Component
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/BusinessSelector.tsx` (NEW)

- Responsive dropdown component for selecting business
- Shows business name, subdomain, and primary badge
- Different UI states:
  - Loading skeleton
  - No businesses (onboarding state)
  - Single business (simplified view, no dropdown)
  - Multiple businesses (full dropdown with hover menu)
- Gradient icon with first letter of business name
- Hover menu with checkmark for selected business

### 4. Dashboard Page Updates
**File**: `app/dashboard/page.tsx` (MODIFIED)

- Wrapped dashboard with `BusinessProvider`
- Integrated `BusinessSelector` in the top bar next to business name
- Passes `selectedBusinessId` to:
  - `Calendar` component
  - `CreateAppointmentModal` component
- Business name in header now shows selected business name

### 5. Calendar Component Updates
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/Calendar.tsx` (MODIFIED)

- Added `businessId` prop to `CalendarProps`
- Passes `businessId` as query parameter when fetching appointments
- Triggers data reload when `businessId` changes (added to useEffect deps)
- Filters appointments by selected business

### 6. Create Appointment Modal Updates
**File**: `src/components/dashboard/CreateAppointmentModal.tsx` (MODIFIED)

- Added `businessId` prop to `CreateAppointmentModalProps`
- Fetches services filtered by `businessId`
- Reloads services when `businessId` changes

### 7. Appointments API Updates
**File**: `app/api/appointments/route.ts` (MODIFIED)

- Added `businessId` to query schema (optional UUID parameter)
- Uses `businessId` from query param if provided, otherwise falls back to JWT token business_id
- Filters appointments by specified business
- Added TODO comment for ownership verification using `user_owns_business()` function

### 8. Services API Updates
**File**: `app/api/services/route.ts` (MODIFIED)

- Added support for `businessId` query parameter
- Uses `businessId` from query if provided, otherwise uses JWT token business_id
- Filters services by specified business
- Added TODO comment for ownership verification

## Data Flow

```
1. User logs in → JWT includes primary business_id
2. Dashboard loads → BusinessProvider fetches all user's businesses via /api/me/businesses
3. BusinessContext auto-selects primary business (or first available)
4. Selected business stored in localStorage for persistence
5. User can switch businesses via BusinessSelector dropdown
6. When business changes:
   - Calendar refetches appointments for new business
   - Create modal refetches services for new business
   - All data filtered by selectedBusinessId
```

## Database Schema

The implementation uses the multi-business ownership structure from migration 013:

- **`business_owners`** junction table: Many-to-many user-business relationships
- **`is_primary`** flag: Indicates default business per owner
- **`get_user_businesses(user_id)`** function: Returns all businesses for a user
- **`user_owns_business(user_id, business_id)`** function: Validates ownership (TODO: use in APIs)

## Future Improvements

1. **Security**: Implement ownership verification in APIs
   - Call `user_owns_business()` before allowing access to businessId
   - Prevent unauthorized access to businesses user doesn't own

2. **Set Primary Business**: Add UI to change which business is primary

3. **Business Creation**: Add "Add New Business" option in selector

4. **Performance**: Add caching for business list to reduce API calls

5. **Settings**: Filter settings pages by selected business

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Login with owner account that has multiple businesses
- [ ] Verify business selector appears in dashboard top bar
- [ ] Switch between businesses and confirm calendar updates
- [ ] Create appointment in one business, switch businesses, verify it doesn't appear
- [ ] Verify localStorage persists selected business on page reload
- [ ] Test with single-business owner (selector should show simplified view)
- [ ] Test with no businesses (should show onboarding message)
- [ ] Verify primary business is auto-selected on first load
