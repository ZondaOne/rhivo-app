# Business Onboarding Guide

Complete guide for onboarding new businesses to the Rivo platform.

---

## Overview

The business onboarding pipeline automates the entire setup process:

1. ‚úÖ Parses and validates YAML configuration
2. ‚úÖ Creates business record in database
3. ‚úÖ Creates owner account with secure credentials
4. ‚úÖ Imports categories and services from YAML
5. ‚úÖ Sets up availability schedule
6. ‚úÖ Links configuration to booking page
7. ‚úÖ Sends welcome email with credentials

**Result:** A fully functional business with booking page ready to accept appointments.

---

## Quick Start

### Method 1: CLI Tool (Recommended for Production)

```bash
# Basic usage
npx tsx scripts/onboard-business.ts config/tenants/wellness-spa.yaml owner@business.com

# With owner name
npx tsx scripts/onboard-business.ts config/tenants/wellness-spa.yaml owner@business.com "Business Owner"
```

**Output:**
```
‚úÖ Onboarding Successful!

üè¢ Business Details:
   ID: wellness-spa
   Subdomain: wellness-spa

üë§ Owner Account:
   Email: owner@business.com
   Temporary Password: Xy9#mK2$pL4@qR8v
   ‚ö†Ô∏è  Owner must change password on first login!

üîó URLs:
   üìß Email Verification: http://localhost:3000/auth/verify-email?token=...
   üìÖ Booking Page: http://localhost:3000/book/wellness-spa
   üè† Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/auth/login
```

### Method 2: Web Interface (For Testing)

1. Navigate to `http://localhost:3000/admin/onboard`
2. Select YAML config file
3. Enter owner email
4. Click "Onboard Business"
5. Copy credentials from success screen

### Method 3: API Endpoint

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/onboard-business \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "yamlFilePath": "config/tenants/wellness-spa.yaml",
    "ownerEmail": "owner@business.com",
    "ownerName": "Business Owner"
  }'
```

---

## YAML Configuration

### 1. Create YAML Config

Create a file in `config/tenants/{business-id}.yaml`:

```yaml
version: "1.0.0"

business:
  id: "my-business"
  name: "My Business Name"
  timezone: "America/New_York"
  # ... rest of config
```

See [example-salon.yaml](../config/tenants/example-salon.yaml) for complete example.

### 2. Validate Config

Before onboarding, validate your YAML:

```typescript
import { parseTenantConfigYAML } from '@/lib/config/tenant-config-parser';
import fs from 'fs/promises';

const yaml = await fs.readFile('config/tenants/my-business.yaml', 'utf-8');
const result = parseTenantConfigYAML(yaml);

if (!result.success) {
  console.error('Validation failed:', result.errors);
}
```

---

## Complete Workflow

### Step 1: Prepare YAML Configuration

Create or customize YAML file with:
- Business information
- Contact details
- Branding (colors, logo)
- Services and categories
- Availability schedule
- Booking rules

### Step 2: Run Onboarding

```bash
npx tsx scripts/onboard-business.ts \
  config/tenants/my-business.yaml \
  owner@mybusiness.com \
  "Owner Name"
```

### Step 3: Share Credentials with Owner

The system outputs:
- ‚úâÔ∏è Email verification link
- üîë Temporary password
- üîó Booking page URL
- üì± Dashboard login URL

### Step 4: Owner First Login

Owner must:
1. Click email verification link
2. Login with temporary password
3. **Immediately change password**
4. Review business settings
5. Test booking flow

### Step 5: Go Live

1. Owner verifies all services are correct
2. Test booking page
3. Share booking URL with customers
4. Monitor dashboard for incoming bookings

## What Gets Created

### Database Records

**Business:**
```sql
INSERT INTO businesses (id, subdomain, name, timezone, config_yaml_path, status)
VALUES ('wellness-spa', 'wellness-spa', 'Tranquillo Spa', 'Europe/Rome', 'config/tenants/...', 'active');
```

**Owner:**
```sql
INSERT INTO users (email, role, business_id, password_hash, email_verification_token)
VALUES ('owner@spa.it', 'owner', 'wellness-spa', 'bcrypt_hash', 'verification_token');
```

**Business-Owner Relationship (Multi-Business Support):**
```sql
-- Junction table linking user to business (supports multiple businesses per owner)
INSERT INTO business_owners (user_id, business_id, is_primary)
VALUES ('owner-uuid', 'wellness-spa', true);
```

> **Note:** As of migration 013, owners can manage multiple businesses. The `business_owners` junction table maintains all business relationships, while `users.business_id` remains for backward compatibility and references the user's primary business.

**Categories & Services:**
```sql
-- From YAML categories array
INSERT INTO categories (business_id, name, sort_order) VALUES ...;
INSERT INTO services (business_id, category_id, name, duration_minutes, price_cents, ...) VALUES ...;
```

**Availability:**
```sql
-- From YAML availability array (all 7 days)
INSERT INTO availability (business_id, day_of_week, start_time, end_time, is_available) VALUES ...;

-- From YAML exceptions (holidays)
INSERT INTO availability (business_id, exception_date, is_available) VALUES ...;
```

### Generated Assets

- üîê Secure temporary password (16 characters, mixed case, numbers, symbols)
- üéüÔ∏è Email verification token (32-byte cryptographic token)
- üîó Verification URL with token
- üìÑ Welcome email template

---

## Testing the Complete Flow

### End-to-End Test

1. **Onboard Business:**
   ```bash
   npx tsx scripts/onboard-business.ts \
     config/tenants/wellness-spa.yaml \
     test@example.com
   ```

2. **Verify Email:**
   - Copy verification URL from output
   - Open in browser
   - Should see "Email verified" message

3. **Login as Owner:**
   - Go to `/auth/login`
   - Use email + temporary password
   - Should be prompted to change password

4. **View Dashboard:**
   - After password change, redirected to dashboard
   - Should see business name in header
   - Calendar should be empty (no appointments yet)

5. **Make Test Booking:**
   - Go to booking page: `/book/{subdomain}`
   - Select service and time
   - Complete guest booking
   - Return to dashboard - appointment should appear!

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Business already exists"

**Cause:** Subdomain collision
**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check existing businesses
SELECT id, subdomain FROM businesses WHERE subdomain = 'wellness-spa';

-- If needed, delete and retry
UPDATE businesses SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE subdomain = 'wellness-spa';
```

### Issue: "Owner email already exists"

**Cause:** Email already registered

**Solution Option 1 - Add Business to Existing Owner (Multi-Business) - RECOMMENDED:**

The onboarding system now automatically handles this! Simply run the onboarding command again with the same owner email:

```bash
npx tsx scripts/onboard-business.ts \
  config/tenants/second-business.yaml \
  owner@business.com
```

The system will:
- Detect the existing owner account
- Add the new business to their account via the `business_owners` junction table
- Skip generating new credentials (owner uses existing password)
- Show a warning that the business was added to an existing owner

Check owner's businesses:
```sql
-- View all businesses for an owner
SELECT u.email, u.role, b.name as business_name, bo.is_primary
FROM users u
JOIN business_owners bo ON u.id = bo.user_id
JOIN businesses b ON bo.business_id = b.id
WHERE u.email = 'owner@business.com'
ORDER BY bo.is_primary DESC, b.name;
```

**Solution Option 2 - Use Different Email:**
Use a different email address for the new business owner.

**Solution Option 3 - Remove Old User (DESTRUCTIVE):**
```sql
-- Delete existing user (also removes junction relationships and all their businesses!)
UPDATE users SET deleted_at = NOW() WHERE email = 'owner@business.com';
```

---

## Multi-Business Ownership

> **Since Migration 013:** A single owner can manage multiple businesses through the `business_owners` junction table.

### How It Works

1. **Automatic Detection:** When onboarding with an existing owner email, the system automatically adds the business to their account
2. **Primary Business:** The first business is marked as `is_primary = true`. Additional businesses are secondary.
3. **No New Credentials:** Existing owners use their current password for all businesses
4. **Business Switching:** Owners can switch between businesses in the dashboard (feature in development)

### Example: Add Second Business

```bash
# First business
npx tsx scripts/onboard-business.ts \
  config/tenants/salon-a.yaml \
  maria@example.com

# Second business (same owner)
npx tsx scripts/onboard-business.ts \
  config/tenants/salon-b.yaml \
  maria@example.com
```

**Output for second business:**
```
‚úÖ Onboarding Successful!

‚ö†Ô∏è  Warnings:
   - Owner account already exists. Adding new business to existing owner: maria@example.com
   - Business added as secondary business. Owner's primary business remains unchanged.

üè¢ Business Details:
   ID: salon-b
   Subdomain: salon-b
   Owner now manages 2 businesses

üîó URLs:
   üìÖ Booking Page: http://localhost:3000/book/salon-b
   üè† Dashboard: http://localhost:3000/auth/login (use existing credentials)
```

### Managing Multiple Businesses

**View all businesses for an owner:**
```sql
SELECT
  b.name,
  b.subdomain,
  bo.is_primary,
  bo.created_at
FROM business_owners bo
JOIN businesses b ON b.id = bo.business_id
WHERE bo.user_id = (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'maria@example.com')
ORDER BY bo.is_primary DESC, b.name;
```

**Change primary business:**
```sql
SELECT set_primary_business(
  (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email = 'maria@example.com'),
  (SELECT id FROM businesses WHERE subdomain = 'salon-b')
);
```

**Count businesses per owner:**
```sql
SELECT
  u.email,
  COUNT(bo.business_id) as business_count
FROM users u
JOIN business_owners bo ON u.id = bo.user_id
WHERE u.role = 'owner'
GROUP BY u.id, u.email
ORDER BY business_count DESC;
```

### Issue: "YAML validation failed"

**Cause:** Invalid configuration
**Solution:**
1. Check YAML syntax
2. Review error messages
3. Fix validation issues
4. Retry onboarding

Common validation errors:
- Missing required fields
- Invalid time format (must be HH:MM)
- Service duration not multiple of time slot
- Invalid timezone
- Duplicate service IDs

### Issue: "Booking page shows 'Business Not Found'"

**Cause:** Config not loaded or subdomain mismatch
**Solution:**
1. Check `config_yaml_path` in database
2. Verify YAML file exists at that path
3. Clear config cache
4. Check subdomain in URL matches business ID

## Advanced Usage

### Bulk Onboarding

Create script to onboard multiple businesses:

```typescript
const businesses = [
  {
    yaml: 'config/tenants/business-1.yaml',
    owner: 'owner1@email.com',
    name: 'Owner 1',
  },
  {
    yaml: 'config/tenants/business-2.yaml',
    owner: 'owner2@email.com',
    name: 'Owner 2',
  },
];

for (const biz of businesses) {
  const result = await onboardBusiness({
    yamlFilePath: biz.yaml,
    ownerEmail: biz.owner,
    ownerName: biz.name,
  });

  console.log(`${biz.owner}: ${result.success ? '‚úÖ' : '‚ùå'}`);
}
```

### Custom Welcome Email

Override default email template:

```typescript
import { onboardBusiness } from '@/lib/onboarding/business-onboarding';

const result = await onboardBusiness({ ... });

if (result.success) {
  await sendCustomWelcomeEmail(
    result.ownerId,
    result.temporaryPassword,
    result.verificationUrl
  );
}
```

### Production Deployment

For production, add:

1. **Admin Authentication** (endpoint currently unprotected)
2. **Rate Limiting** (prevent abuse)
3. **Audit Logging** (track who onboards what)
4. **Email Service** (replace console.log with real emails)
5. **Monitoring** (alert on failures)

---

## Security Considerations

### Password Security

- ‚úÖ Temporary passwords are 16+ characters
- ‚úÖ Include mixed case, numbers, symbols
- ‚úÖ Hashed with bcrypt (cost factor 12)
- ‚úÖ Forced change on first login
- ‚úÖ Not stored in plain text

### Email Verification

- ‚úÖ Cryptographically secure tokens (32 bytes)
- ‚úÖ Tokens hashed before storage
- ‚úÖ 24-hour expiration
- ‚úÖ Single-use tokens

### API Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **TODO:** Add authentication to `/api/admin/onboard-business`

Currently anyone can call this endpoint. Add:
```typescript
const { isAdmin } = await verifyAdminToken(request);
if (!isAdmin) return NextResponse.json({ error: 'Unauthorized' }, { status: 401 });
```
