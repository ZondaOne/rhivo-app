# Revenue System Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ Completed: Phase 1 - Core Subscription System (Mock Mode)

This implementation provides the **complete foundation** for Rhivo's B2B SaaS freemium model, with all feature gating in place but using a **contact sales modal** instead of Stripe payments until bureaucratic requirements (VAT, e-invoicing) are completed.

## üéØ How to Use the System

### 1. **Check Feature Access in Code**
```typescript
import { checkFeatureAccess } from '@/lib/subscription/feature-gates';

const featureCheck = await checkFeatureAccess(businessId, 'analyticsLevel');
if (!featureCheck.hasAccess) {
  // Show upgrade modal or locked component
  return <LockedFeature {...featureCheck} />;
}
```

### 2. **Gate API Endpoints**
```typescript
import { checkFeatureAccess } from '@/lib/subscription/feature-gates';

export async function GET(request: NextRequest) {
  const featureCheck = await checkFeatureAccess(businessId, 'exportData');
  if (!featureCheck.hasAccess) {
    return NextResponse.json({
      error: 'Feature not available',
      ...featureCheck,
    }, { status: 403 });
  }

  // Feature available, proceed...
}
```

### 3. **Show Upgrade Prompts**
```tsx
const { showUpgrade, UpgradeModal } = useUpgrade({ currentTier });

<button onClick={() => showUpgrade({
  suggestedTier: 'pro',
  featureName: 'Multi-location Support',
  message: 'Manage multiple locations with the Growth plan'
})}>
  Add Location
</button>

<UpgradeModal />
```

## üìã What's Left to Implement

### ‚è≥ TODO: Stripe Integration (Blocked by Bureaucracy)

**Required before Stripe:**
1. ‚úÖ Italian VAT registration (Partita IVA)
2. ‚úÖ E-invoicing service setup (Fatture in Cloud or Aruba)
3. ‚úÖ Stripe account setup with Italian tax configuration
4. ‚úÖ Create Stripe products for each tier
5. ‚úÖ Legal: Terms of Service, Privacy Policy updates

**When ready, implement:**
- [ ] `/api/billing/create-subscription` - Create Stripe subscription
- [ ] `/api/billing/cancel-subscription` - Cancel subscription
- [ ] `/api/billing/portal` - Redirect to Stripe customer portal
- [ ] `/api/webhooks/stripe` - Handle subscription events
- [ ] Replace `mailto:` links with Stripe checkout

**Files to create (see revenue.xml for implementation details):**
- `app/api/billing/create-subscription/route.ts`
- `app/api/billing/cancel-subscription/route.ts`
- `app/api/billing/portal/route.ts`
- `app/api/webhooks/stripe/route.ts`

---

## üöÄ Next Steps to Test

### 1. **Test Feature Gates**
```bash
# All businesses default to free tier
# Analytics endpoints should return 403

curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  "http://localhost:3000/api/insights/revenue?businessId=xxx"

# Expected: 403 with upgradeRequired: true
```

### 2. **Manually Upgrade a Business (for testing)**
```sql
UPDATE businesses
SET subscription_tier = 'basic',
    max_staff_members = 5,
    sms_quota = 100,
    branding_enabled = true,
    analytics_enabled = true,
    remove_watermark = true
WHERE id = 'YOUR_BUSINESS_ID';
```

### 3. **Test the Pricing Page**
Visit: `http://localhost:3000/pricing`

### 4. **Test Upgrade Modals**
- Try accessing `/dashboard/insights` on a free tier account
- Should show locked feature component
- Click upgrade ‚Üí Contact sales modal appears

---

## üéâ Summary

You now have a **fully functional freemium subscription system** with:
- ‚úÖ Database schema for 4-tier model
- ‚úÖ Feature gating on API endpoints
- ‚úÖ UI components for locked features and upgrades
- ‚úÖ Public pricing page
- ‚úÖ "Powered by Rhivo" badge for free tier
- ‚úÖ Contact sales flow (mock Stripe)

**All that remains is Stripe integration once bureaucracy is complete.**

The system is designed to:
1. Let free users explore the product
2. Show clear value of paid tiers
3. Make upgrading easy (currently via email, later Stripe)
4. Scale with business growth (staff, locations, features)

---

## üìß Contact for Upgrades (Current Mock Flow)

All upgrade CTAs currently point to:
- **Email:** team@zonda.one
- **Modal:** Shows "Contact Sales Team" button
- **Success:** "We'll be in touch!" confirmation

Once Stripe is integrated, these will redirect to checkout flows.
