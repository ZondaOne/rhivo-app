# Step 11: Business Discovery Interface - Implementation

**Status:** ✅ Phase 1 Complete
**Date:** 2025-10-04

## Overview

Built the foundation for the business discovery interface at `/book` (no subdomain), allowing customers to browse all active businesses on the platform before selecting one to book with.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Discovery Page UI (`/book/page.tsx`)
- **List View**: Grid layout showing business cards with cover images, descriptions, locations, and categories
- **Map View**: ✅ Interactive Leaflet map with OpenStreetMap tiles
- **Search**: Real-time search filtering by business name, description, or location
- **View Toggle**: Switch between list and map views
- **Responsive Design**: Following the Rhivo style guide (Functional Minimalism)

### 1a. Map Integration (`/app/book/components/BusinessMap.tsx`)
- **Technology**: Leaflet.js + React Leaflet (free, open-source, no API key required)
- **Tile Provider**: OpenStreetMap (free community tiles)
- **Italy-Focused**: Centered on Italy (lat: 43.0, long: 12.0) with zoom level 6
- **City Coordinates**: Temporary geocoding using hardcoded Italian city coordinates (Firenze, Roma, Milano, etc.)
- **Interactive Markers**: Click markers to view business details and navigate to booking page
- **Popups**: Rich business info cards with categories, description, and CTA button
- **Auto-Fit Bounds**: Map automatically zooms to fit all business markers

### 2. Discovery API (`/api/businesses/discover`)
- Fetches all active businesses from database
- Loads YAML config for each business to extract:
  - Business name and description
  - Contact address (street, city, state, country)
  - Categories and service counts
  - Branding (cover image, primary color)
- Returns aggregated business summaries
- Error handling for businesses with missing/invalid configs

### 3. Features Implemented
✅ Public discovery page at `/book`
✅ List view with business cards
✅ Interactive map view with Leaflet/OpenStreetMap
✅ Search functionality (name, description, location)
✅ Category display (up to 3 badges + count)
✅ Cover image or gradient fallback
✅ Seamless redirect to `/book/[subdomain]` on click (works in both list and map)
✅ Map markers with rich popups
✅ Auto-zoom to fit all markers
✅ Empty state handling
✅ Loading states

## Data Sources

Currently using **YAML config files** for business data:
- `business.name` - Display name
- `business.description` - Business description
- `contact.address` - Full address object
- `categories[]` - Service categories with service counts
- `branding.coverImageUrl` - Cover photo
- `branding.primaryColor` - Brand color for gradients

## UI/UX Details

### Following Style Guide
- **Colors**: Teal/green brand gradient, gray neutrals
- **Typography**: SF Pro Display, tight tracking, bold headings
- **Spacing**: Consistent 8px grid, generous whitespace
- **Borders**: rounded-2xl (16px) on cards, rounded-xl (12px) on buttons
- **Shadows**: Minimal use, hover states with shadow-xl
- **Transitions**: Smooth hover effects with scale and color changes

### Business Card Component
```
┌─────────────────────────┐
│   Cover Image/Gradient  │  <- 192px height
├─────────────────────────┤
│ Business Name           │  <- Bold, text-xl
│ Description (2 lines)   │  <- text-sm, gray-500
│ 📍 City, State          │  <- Location icon + text
│ [Category] [Category]   │  <- Category badges
│ ─────────────────────   │
│ View & Book         →   │  <- CTA with arrow
└─────────────────────────┘
```

## Map Implementation Details

### Leaflet + OpenStreetMap
- **Why Leaflet?** Free, lightweight, no API keys, works great for basic mapping
- **Tiles**: Using OpenStreetMap's free tile server (`https://{s}.tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png`)
- **Geocoding Strategy**: Temporary hardcoded city coordinates for Italian cities
- **Dynamic Import**: Map component loaded client-side only (no SSR) to avoid Next.js hydration issues

### Italy City Coordinates (Temporary)
```typescript
const italyCityCoordinates = {
  'Firenze': [43.7696, 11.2558],
  'Roma': [41.9028, 12.4964],
  'Milano': [45.4642, 9.1900],
  'Venezia': [45.4408, 12.3155],
  // ... more cities
};
```

This will be replaced with actual database lat/long in Step 12.

## What's NOT Implemented (Step 12)

The following features require database schema changes (Step 12):

❌ Geolocation stored in database (latitude/longitude columns)
❌ Distance calculations from user location
❌ "Nearest" sorting
❌ Filter by distance radius
❌ Next available slot display
❌ Business ratings/reviews
❌ Filter by category, service type, price range
❌ Filter by availability (today, this week, date range)
❌ Pagination/infinite scroll
❌ Business visibility toggle
❌ Geocoding API for automatic address → lat/long conversion

## Technical Decisions

### Why YAML First?
- Step 11 focuses on **interface**, Step 12 on **data layer**
- YAML configs already contain rich business data
- Allows us to build and test UI without waiting for DB migration
- Easy to extend with database fields later

### API Design
- Single endpoint: `GET /api/businesses/discover`
- Returns denormalized data (flattened for frontend)
- Graceful degradation if config fails to load
- Ready to add query parameters for filtering later

### Performance Considerations
- Currently loads all business configs (manageable for ~10-50 businesses)
- TODO: Add caching layer (Redis/in-memory) for Step 12
- TODO: Add pagination when count exceeds 100 businesses

## Next Steps (Step 12)

See `prompt.xml` Step 12 for complete requirements. Summary:

1. **Database Migration**: Add to `businesses` table:
   - `latitude DECIMAL(10, 8)`
   - `longitude DECIMAL(11, 8)`
   - `description TEXT`
   - `cover_photo_url TEXT`
   - `featured_services JSONB`
   - `visibility_status` (active/hidden)

2. **Geospatial Indexes**: For distance queries
3. **Discovery API Enhancement**: Filter params, caching, pagination
4. **"Next Available Slot" Job**: Hourly batch update
5. **Map Integration**: Mapbox or Google Maps
6. **Advanced Filters**: Category, service, price, hours, distance, availability

## Success Criteria

✅ Customers can browse all businesses
✅ Page loads quickly with clean UI
✅ Search works in real-time
✅ Seamless navigation to booking flow
